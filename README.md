- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Install Dependencies
- Has to be execute in linux based environment

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregorybi/cv_llm.git
cd cv_llm
```

2. Dowload the Model (Install Dependencies)
```bash
pip install transformers torch nltk
```
Youâ€™ll download the model the first time you run it.

## Execute
1. Edit the resume_text variable inside resume_analyzer.py with your resume content (or load a resume from a file).
